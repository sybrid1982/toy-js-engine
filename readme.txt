This will be a very simple javascript toy engine written in rust for my own educational purposes.

Currently does basic math (without parentheses), statements must end in a semicolon.

To do:
Maybe make semicolon usage more forgiving
Add parentheses for math
Add functions

run main.rs, and at the empty line, type something simple like "3 + 5 * 6;", should get 33 printed below that.
