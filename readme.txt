This will be a very simple javascript toy engine written in rust for my own educational purposes.

Currently does basic math (without parentheses) and variable assignment (of numbers)

To do:
Add parentheses for math
Add functions
Add logical operators
Add conditionals

run main.rs, and at the empty line, type something simple like "3 + 5 * 6;", should get 33 printed below that.
Or type "let x = 3 * 5; x + 3;", should see "> 18" as a response.
